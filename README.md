# Embedded based Car Safety System.
A.The main reason for Car accident is Alcohol Consumption and not wearing the Seatbelt.
B.In this Project I have interfaced MQ3 Alcolhol sensor and the hall sensor for measuring alcohol level and the seatbelt is on or not.
C.If the consumption level reaches to the permissible point then call to relatives or owner of this vehicle takes place through GSM module.
D.Also the vehicle does not turn on when any of these things Happen:
      1. Does not wearing a Seatbelt
      2. Alcohol level above permissible value
      3. Any of the door of the vehicle is open.
